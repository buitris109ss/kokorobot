<!-- <p>It's funny, my favorite gaming memories are never because the games themselves were especially memorable, or good, but because of the people that were with me. I loved playing Resident Evil with my sisters as a kid, we were all too scared to play alone so we played together. Another sister-related memory, was when playing Mario Kart on SNS... we wouldn't hurt each other, we'd go around taking items, hoping to get a banana, then we'd take the bananas and find safe places for them around the levels(once in a while, someone would violate the safe banana pact, offing a banana, and then some shell-throwing would ensue). I loved playing Starcraft: Brood War with Devine in the evening, drink in hand, messing around. Also, that time I smashed up my knee while cycling in Tokyo, we were supposed to go out but couldn't because of my injury, so Devine and Chase set up a computer and we played Borderlands all day.</p> -->
