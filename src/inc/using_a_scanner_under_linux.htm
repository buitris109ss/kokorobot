<p>Growing up with a variety of scanners, and having to deal with shitty software and compability issues, I assumed that getting an older scanner to work with Linux would be impossible- I was wrong.</p>

<p>I have a used <b>CanoScanLiDE20</b>, {Obi} run Manjaro, and scan my art using <b>Simple Scan</b>.</p>

<h3>Required Software</h3>

<p>To scan images with linux you'll need:</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/simple-scan" target="_blank">Simple Scan</a></b> - a stand-alone software to control the scanner for SANE </li>
<li><b><a href='sane-project.org' target='_blank'>SANE</a></b> - what makes the scanner compatible with Linux.</li>
</ul>

<p>To make sure that your chosen scanner will work with SANE, check <a href='http://www.sane-project.org/sane-mfgs.html' target='_blank'>this list</a>. My scanner was part of that list.</p>

<p>So, it is time to install both:</p>

<pre>
sudo pacman -S simple-scan
and...
sudo pacman -S sane
</pre>

<p>Then, plug in your scanner, launch Simple Scan, and voila!</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/XSane/" target="_blank">Xsane</a> previously, but according to the <a href="http://sane-project.org/sane-frontends.html" target="_blank">Sane webpage</a> the package is temporarily offline(2025). I will use Simple Scan in the meantime.</p>
