<p>A short post to make it clear where I stand as a person, and with my work.</p>

<p><b>This website has no tracking or analytics</b>, and <b>the art and writing is all done by a human.</b></p>

<p>AI art is hollow, it is a grotesque parody of what it is to be human.</p>

<q>We make art because art is how humans create meaning for themselves and each other. The reason blues and Irish folk music go so hard is because they were made by people who were constantly having to insist upon their own humanity.</q><cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0rpCUIYVJg" target="_blank">Mariana Colin (The Morbid Zoo)</a></cite>

<p>The harms from AI are <a href="https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023/" target="_blank">real</a>, ongoing, and stem from corporations deploying automated systems with little thought about transparency, accountability and exploitative labor practices.</p>

<q>The algorithmification of society and the narratives used to make it appear inevitable serve specific interests, mostly profitable for and controlled by few actors. It is not AI in itself, but the utilitarian sophistication of optimisation mechanisms and the power structures behind them that profit from controlling all that we do, when and how we do it, our behaviours, and even ourselves.</q><cite><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382802495_Deconstructing_the_AI_Myth_Fallacies_and_Harms_of_Algorithmification" target="_blank">Dagmar Monett and Bogdan Grigorescu</a></cite>

<p>The environmental impacts, which include ever-expanding demand for computing power, larger carbon footprints, and accelerated draining of natural resources, is overshadowed by its exciting(distracting) and seemingly infinite possibilities, like enhanced productivity and unlimited creativity(both <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/challenging-the-myths-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank">myths</a>). And finally, the icing on this terrible cake of nightmares is that AI is a threat to democracy because of its ceaseless flooding of the entire information ecosystem with garbage and misinformation, resulting in people having difficulty verifying what is true and what isn't.</p>

<p>I follow a <b>plant-based diet</b>. The treatment of animals ought to be done with respect and compassion, but as it stands today, it remains crude and barbaric. That humans have an absolute right to authority over all other animals is erroneous. Universal compassion is the <b>only</b> guarantee of morality.</p>

<p>I am <b>committed</b> to fighting normative violence, fascism, colonialism, and white supremacy in all of its forms. To undermine the capitalist structure and its abusive scripts about human worth in relation to work, productivity, and ownership. To subvert oppressive gender norms and put in question the binary. To actively unlearn biased and colonial thinking.</p>

<p>I am <b>aggressively</b> opposed to racism, sexism, homophobia, speciesism, transphobia, nationalism, ethnocentrism, religious fundamentalism, and oppressive and coercive power structures of all kinds.</p>

<p>Way to speak your mind, Hakazi! Though really, he borrowed those words from the fantastic <a href='https://blood-and-dust.com/politics/' target='_blank'>Blood and Dust</a> project.</p>
