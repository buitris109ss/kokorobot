<h2>2025-07-28 Ukee</h2>

<p>I've managed to miss writing an update last month, I've been a bit distracted due to all of the traveling. Since leaving Texada Island we've sailed to the San Juan Islands, and then over to Ucluelet on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. There are a lot of beautiful places on this coast. We were lucky to have seen plenty of orcas, and 1 very young and energetic humpback whale. I wish that we'd had less weather while in Ucluelet, but it's a really lovely place. We visited the Ukee catch-and-release aquarium, saw many beautiful anemones, sea cucumbers and several different species of fish, all native to Clayoquot and Barkley Sound.<br>On our return in the Gulf Islands, we dropped the hook near friends. We have been enjoying some quiet time since then, catching up on projects, going on hikes, working my way to making 5 pull-ups(SO close!).</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I'm happy to report that since my last update, I can do about 4 pull-ups! The quality of the 4th one varies, depending on how much energy I have. I've also been training with a resistance band on the side. It was a good idea to get one for the summer, it is a good way to combat restlessness when going to shore is not possible.<br>We are currently moored near an island with many good trails, so we have plenty of options.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I released a new <a href='rabbit_waves.html' class='local'>rabbit waves</a> page called <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/boatswain_call.html">Boatswain's Call</a>. All the traveling has left me with little time to produce larger and more complex projects, and so I focused on making many small rabbit portraits(<a href='punk_rabbits.html' class='local'>punk rabbits</a>). I'm hoping to make 100 of these, as a personal challenge.<br>Dev & I also worked on a small but difficult game called <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/polycat" target="_blank">Polycat</a>(yes, based on <a href='mindbird.html' class='local'>mindbird</a>'s <a href='polycat.html' class='local'>polycat</a>).</p> 

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I read Girl's Last Tour, a manga by Tsukumizu. It is a beautiful story which tackles some very difficult and heavy topics. It is about resilience, companionship, just living one day at a time, creating all the while, doing the best that we can with the time we've got. Humanity will create to the end, even when the end is within sight. There is something both sad and remarkable about this. I was in tears when I finished it. It destroyed me. I was all but useless after that for the rest of the day. I recommend it, but maybe make sure you've got a comfy blanket or a warm body nearby to cuddle up into, you'll need it.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I finished watched Better Call Saul. Yes, many years after its release(it takes me a while). What a fantastic show! I love Jimmy and Kim's relationship. I love the respect that he has for her, it burns bright throughout the series and it is amazing. Kim isn't perfect, but she is accountable, and that is so, so rare, especially for someone who's actions have hurt a lot of people. It was exciting throughout, and has a well-crafted ending.<br>A friend had Devine & I watch Buckaroo Banzai. I still don't know what I think about it, it is the type of movie that requires a second, and maybe third watch, not because it's confusing but because it is very odd and because there are too many details to look at. It is amazing to think that someone greenlit this movie. Many lines do not make sense, the plot is full of holes, but the sets are fun, the choice of outfits is fantastic, and seeing a younger John Lithgow overacting and speaking with a bad Italian accent is very entertaining.</p>
