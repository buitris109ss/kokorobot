<h2>2025-07-28 Ukee</h2>

<p>I've managed to miss writing an update last month, I've been a bit distracted due to all of the traveling. Since leaving Texada Island we've sailed to the San Juan Islands, and then over to Ucluelet on the West Coast of Vancouver Island. There are a lot of beautiful places on this coast. We were lucky to have seen plenty of orcas, and 1 very young and energetic humpback whale. I wish that we'd had less weather while in Ucluelet, but it's a really lovely place. We visited the Ukee catch-and-release aquarium, saw many beautiful anemones, sea cucumbers and several different species of fish, all native to Clayoquot and Barkley Sound.<br>On our return in the Gulf Islands, we dropped the hook near friends. We have been enjoying some quiet time since then, catching up on projects, going on hikes, working my way to making 5 pull-ups(SO close!).</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I'm happy to report that since my last update, I can do about 4 pull-ups! The quality of the 4th one varies, depending on how much energy I have. I've also been training with a resistance band on the side. It was a good idea to get one for the summer, it is a good way to combat restlessness when going to shore is not possible.<br>We are currently moored near an island with many good trails, so we have plenty of options.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I released a new <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a> page called <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/boatswain_call.html">Boatswain's Call</a>. All the traveling has left me with little time to produce larger and more complex projects, and so I focused on making many small rabbit portraits(<a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/punk_rabbits.html">Punk Rabbits</a>). I'm hoping to make 100 of these, as a personal challenge.<br>Dev & I also worked on a small but difficult game called <a href="https://hundredrabbits.itch.io/polycat" target="_blank">Polycat</a>(yes, based on <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/mindbird.html">Minbird</a>'s <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/polycat.html">Polycat</a>).</p> 

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I read Girl's Last Tour, a manga by Tsukumizu. It is a beautiful story which tackles some very difficult and heavy topics. It is about resilience, companionship, just living one day at a time, creating all the while, doing the best that we can with the time we've got. Humanity will create to the end, even when the end is within sight. There is something both sad and remarkable about this. I was in tears when I finished it. It destroyed me. I was all but useless after that for the rest of the day. I recommend it, but maybe make sure you've got a comfy blanket or a warm body nearby to cuddle up into, you'll need it.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I finished watched Better Call Saul. Yes, many years after its release(it takes me a while). What a fantastic show! I love Jimmy and Kim's relationship. I love the respect that he has for her, it burns bright throughout the series and it is amazing. Kim isn't perfect, but she is accountable, and that is so, so rare, especially for someone who's actions have hurt a lot of people. It was exciting throughout, and has a well-crafted ending.<br>A friend had Devine & I watch Buckaroo Banzai. I still don't know what I think about it, it is the type of movie that requires a second, and maybe third watch, not because it's confusing but because it is very odd and because there are too many details to look at. It is amazing to think that someone greenlit this movie. Many lines do not make sense, the plot is full of holes, but the sets are fun, the choice of outfits is fantastic, and seeing a younger John Lithgow overacting and speaking with a bad Italian accent is very entertaining.</p>

  <title>Whack Follol Le-Dah</title>

<![CDATA[<h2>2025-06-09 Whack Follol Le-Dah</h2>

<p>It appears that I have been too busy to work on my site of late! I managed to miss a monthly update, and it is because Devine & I have left the Victoria docks and have been busy sailing northward to Texada for a haul-out. The timing with the weather was difficult, it's been very windy ever since we arrived on the water. We left on a very blustery day, and the blusteriness has not let up often. We arrived to Texada a few days ahead of the haul-out, staying ahead of strong northwesterlies. Pino became a land creature for a few days, while we repainted the bottom, changed the zincs and did other out-of-water maintenance. Now, Pino is back in their element, we are in Ballet Bay waiting for some strong weather to pass so we can head back southward.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. Since leaving the dock, I have been working my way to making a single pull-up. It is not easy, I have long neglected my arms in favor of my legs. After a bit of practice, I am able to pull myself up when standing on a low step and heaving my body from there, but I cannot do it from a fully hanging position. To work my way to a full single pull-up, I've been doing reverse pull-ups, which involves starting from the finished position and lowering myself down slowly into a full hanging position. My arms and shoulders are tired, but I have a lot of time to practice and work my way to make one.<br>Devine bought an elastic so we could turn Pino into a floating gym. We get restless aboard a lot, especially when anchored in places where we cannot walk ashore, so this will help.</br>I feel good currently, in my head and in my body and I hope that it lasts.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I finished a <a href="kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_sabo_08.jpg">yet another page</a> for <a href="kokorobot.ca/site/sabotage_study.html">Sabotage Study</a> for <a href="kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a>, in which Hakazi and Dae sign together in silence some more, and have a friendly visit. I really like shading and drawing with pencils. I'd like to work my way to making many more full pencil illustrations like my self-appointed sensei, and pencil-shading master Hiroaki Samura. I recently completed a pencil illustration for <a href="kokorobot.ca/site/mindbird.html">mindbird</a>, featuring the <a href='kokorobot.ca/media/content/illustration/illustration.mindbirdgroup_full.jpg' target="blank">characters together</a>.<br>Also, Bill Atkinson, who created Hypercard, and who was the creator of my favorite dithering algorithm, has passed away. RIP Bill. Your work lives on.</p> 

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I have finally finished reading The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. I read aloud to Devine most nights, and I very much enjoyed reading for Boris. His "flow of speech" was really quirky and fun. Although, the Goldfinch could have been 300 pages shorter. Most of the characters in this book are a bit of a mess, that is fine, but even walking alongside Theo across 800 pages wasn't long enough to warm up to him as a person. In all, I like Tartt's writing, and I enjoyed her descriptions of artwork, people and places, but this is not a book I would ever care to revisit.<br>Next, I read through Andy Weir's Artemis, my least favorite of his works. Weir is Mark Whatney, he is Ryland Grace, he is also Jazz Bashara... the problem with him being the hand-puppet and voice of Jazz Bashara is that she is a 26-year old Saudi Arabian woman. With his voice, she sounds like a rude pubescent boy. Once you look past Andy-Jazz, Andy-Dale and Andy-Svoboda, the world of Artemis is actually very rich and fun. Weir truly shines when describing the city, its innerworkings, and the complexities of manufacturing material and welding in space. It his evident from his writing that he spent a lot of time designing this world. Solving problems in space continues to be what he writes best.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>. I went to see the movie Sinners twice at the theater. Yes, it was that good! I saw it with Dev in Victoria, then again with another friend in Sidney. Films like this give me hope for the future, that there are still directors out there who love what they do, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rz3xHhOLK6M" target="_blank">collaborate to make beautiful original creative projects with their friends</a>. The music in Sinners is excellent, I've been humming Sammy's and Remmick's songs for a few weeks now. Whack follol le-dah!<br>I also watched The Boy and The Beast by Mamoru Hosoda, not a new film, but I had not yet seen it. I loved the first 3/4's of the film, but was disappointed with the climax and resolution. It will be difficult to want to watch it again because of what it becomes, I felt the same way about the second half of the movie Your Name by Makoto Shinkai. In the Boy and the Beast, there was an opportunity to do something great, to talk deeply and seriously about chosen families, but Hosoda instead insisted on heart swords and dark chest vortexes. Damn it... Kumatetsu deserved better.</p>

<q>As the culture of the Who Cares Era grinds towards the lowest common denominator, support those that are making real things. Listen to something with your full attention. Watch something with your phone in the other room. Read an actual paper magazine or a book. Be yourself. Be imperfect. Be human. Care.</q>

<![CDATA[<h2>2025-04-19 Reboot</h2>

<p>This month, the weather is warmer and we are busy cleaning up the boat, airing out the lockers, drying off items temporarily corrupted by mould and moisture. Anything stored in the v-berth lockers suffers from extreme wetness. It is a very, very annoying fact of boat life, but there is really no way to promote good air flow in those spaces. Unfortunately, we kept a box of older backup laptops in a locker that usually does not get wet in the winter, but alas, this space was also corrupted and the laptops have all suffered damage. We had to recycle them.<br>To continue with tales of computer troubles, I had to nuke the OS on my main working computer due to a corrupted database(I could no longer update my system). Now, my computer is working fine again! I also managed to revive my older Macbook2010, which was also plagued by some OS/hardware issues. I put the machine to work converting and compressing movie files to save space on our external hard drives, and so that they are <a href="https://100r.co/site/ipad_media_station.html" target="_blank">playable on an old Ipad2</a>.<br>After installing the latest Manjaro i3 update, I found out that Xsane, the scanning software I was using, was no longer available (temporarily, supposedly), so in the meantime I had to install Simple Scan(Linux software). I updated my page on <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/using_a_scanner_under_linux.html">using a scanner under linux</a> to indicate this.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. For the past 2 months I've been immersed in medicine, and first-aid knowledge — I blame <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/rabbit_waves.html">Rabbit Waves</a> for this uptick in interest. When I shared a list of suggestions for meds and items in a first-aid kit online on Mastodon people responded enthusiastically, mentionning additional items I had not considered which encouraged me to continue pulling on that thread. I've updated our own onboard med and first-aid kits, while throwing away long-expired items. While in New Zealand in 2017 a sailing couple we knew sold their boat and gave me and Devine their extremely comprehensive, Swiss-German labelled, med kit, which was sized for a family of 4(they traveled with 2 young kids). We threw away expired epinephrine vials and other antiobiotics, but non-perishable items like suture thread and needles, surgical gloves, and scalpel blades are still good(provided that the packaging seal isn't broken).<br>In an unrelated event I found The Onboard Medical Guide in a used book shelf in town, written by Paul G. Gill Jr. M.D., a certified emergency medicine specialist, which manages to cover a lot of material in a concise manner. My takeaway so far is that the human body is so, so fragile, and that a boat is a dangerous playground, more reason to have a good kit aboard and the skills to deal with wounds and other likely ailments.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I animated some drawings on the Rabbit Waves page for <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/triangular_bandage.html" target="_blank">Triangular Bandages</a>, and appended a .txt file with all of the med and first-aid reccomendations as well as their intended usage.<br>I finished a new page for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/sabotage_study.html">Sabotage Study</a> for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a>. I am super pleased with the nighttime shading on this one, the page reads well!<br>I shared an extended version of a website update I wrote in 2023, called <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/kid_rek.html">kid rek</a>, about re-learning to love drawing for myself.</p> 

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I am still reading The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt, it's a very long book and I am almost all the way through it. I have some thoughts on this book, but I will wait until I have finished reading it before elaborating.<br>We thinned our onboard library, bringing a pile of books over to Russell Books in Victoria. This store accept used books that are in good condition, "buying" them back in return for store credit. Devine returned with many new-to-us books to read for the summer, purchased with our store credit. This is a <b>very</b> good system. We gave them our ancient edition of Adventure of Nils, a book that is gorgeous but that will deteriorate too quickly aboard Pino. Nothing lasts on a boat, especially time-worn books.</p>

<p><b>MOVIE</b>, I went to see Flow, a Latvian animated film. I didn't know what to expect, I had seen images shared around but I never looked it up. A marina neighbor mentioned it was playing at the theater, and convinced Devine & I to go. What a simple, beautiful film...! It communicates such important ideas about cooperation in times of crisis, something that has been on my mind a lot of late. It is worth seeing, I highly reccommend it.</p>

<p>Poem <b>Afternoon on a Hill</b> by Edna St. Vincent Millay.</p>
<pre>
I will be the gladdest thing
    Under the sun!
I will touch a hundred flowers
    And not pick one.

I will look at cliffs and clouds
    With quiet eyes,
Watch the wind bow down the grass,
    And the grass rise.

And when lights begin to show
    Up from the town,
I will mark which must be mine,
    And then start down!
</pre>

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION</b>. After watching Carole Cadwalladr's latest TED Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZOoT8AbkNE" target="_blank">This Is What a Digital Coup Looks Like</a>, I donated some money to <a href="https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton" target="_blank">WayBack Machine</a>. If you're a heavy user, like I am, you should too. Cadwalladr has been through a lot to give this talk, give it a watch and <a href="https://substack.com/@carolecadwalla" target="_blank">keep up with her updates</a> because she might need our support again soon. I <b>really</b> wish she used a platform other than Substack to broadcast her views, though.<br>I've shared C.C. O'Hanlon's <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-voyage-in-search-of-home" target="_blank">call for aid</a> here before, and I will again until both he, and his partner Given are able to buoy back to the surface and stay there. Give what you can, every donation, no matter how small, makes a big difference. </p>

<![CDATA[<h2>2025-03-19 Digital Dignity</h2>

<p>Ah, yes, March! It's getting warmer, buds are blooming, the Trump administration is threatening Canadian Sovereignty — what a time to be alive!</p>

<p><b>POLITICS</b>. The digital erasure of marginalized communities is on the rise, all the more reason for people to host their own content, outside of platforms(like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X and Substack) to escape the cull. When you post content exclusively on these platforms, you build their assets, not yours, and you require their permission to reach an audience.<br>Whatever happens, do not stop making art, and do not stop telling stories. In a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/lin-manuel-miranda-what-art-can-do/600787/" target="_blank">2019 article</a>, playwright Lin-Manuel Miranda addressed the power and importance of stories in the Trumpist Age, "Art lives in the world, and we exist in the world, and we cannot create honest work about the world in which we live without reflecting it. If the work tells the truth, it will live on." So, do not stop creating, ever, and publish the work online in a way that honors your digital dignity, like on a personal website, on Pixelfed or on Mastodon.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I've released 2 new pages for <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca" target="_blank">rabbit waves</a>. Both pages are about first-aid, the first is about building a <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/first_aid_kit.html" target="_blank">First-Aid Kit</a>, and the second is about <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/triangular_bandage.html" target="_blank">Triangular Bandages</a>, a specific item found in every basic first-aid kit. I also updated <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/emergency_bag.html" target="_blank">Emergency Bag</a> with some extra colored illustrations, to help break up the text.</p> 

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I started to learn how to play squash at Devine's gym, taking advantage of the many guest passes that come with their membership. I played racquetsports a bit during college, but not since. I am not as terrible as I thought I would be, and everytime I play I get better. Our marina neighbor has been playing for a long time and is teaching us both. I missed doing some kind of physical activity requiring sudden explosive movements. Winter is very rainy in the Pacific Northwest, it is nice to do more indoor activities.</p>

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. I finished re-watching Breaking Bad, I hadn't seen it since it first came out in 2008. I enjoyed getting re-acquainted with its cast and storyline, although I found hyper-masculine characters like Hank difficult to stomach(the way he treats Mary after his accident is awful, and never really talked about in the show). I found that the writers of the show were excessively abusive to Jesse, especially in the last season. Much of the violence directed toward him was unwarranted. The show is a good portrayal of what male pride can do to a desperate man, it was worth a re-watch, but I didn't enjoy the follow-up movie El Camino. El Camino, starring Jesse, suffers because it was given the 'Netflix look." The pacing is terrible, the mood is needlessly dark and dank, and the audience is given, what I'm going to call "mystery nuggets" non-stop. Mystery nuggets are small bits of information that suggest something is going to happen, meant to "keep an audience hooked," but it is wearisome. On top of it all, Jesse's character, while excellent in Breaking Bad, does not work well as a stand-alone. The writers even managed to have him act contrary to his values. Yes, "hurt people hurt people," but Jesse was never that person and I loved him for that. In all, some plot lines are better left unexplored.<br>I started to watch Better Call Saul, and so far I am very delighted with the series, more than I was watching Breaking Bad.</p>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I have put down Middlemarch temporarily, because Devine bought The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. I've been reading chapters aloud to them every night. Switching from one book to the other was a bit jarring. Eliot is an excellent psychological novelist, the same could be said of Tartt's writing, but it lacks Eliot's wit and astuteness. The thing to remember is to not follow modern novels with 19th century novels.<br>I've also been reading Deviant Ollam's book called Practical Lock Picking, in the interest of getting into locksport. Many years ago I bought a Southord's BPXS-12 kit for Devine has a birthday gift, so I've been tinkering with that.</p>

<p><b>MUSIC</b>. I have been listening to old favorites a lot, like Ghostland Observatory and The Faint. I'd like to get back into the habit of listening to full albums by bands, to re-learn to stay with the content longer rather than opting to listen to songs by a number of artists all mixed in together. A lot of albums are designed to tell a story, and really, I am missing that.</p>

<p><b>COOKING</b>. I published a recipe for a favorite onboard Pino: <a href="https://grimgrains.com/site/stovetop_zaatar_pizza.html" target="_blank">Za'atar Stovetop Pizza</a>. I've also started using the pizza base just to prepare flat bread for hummus. I cut it up into small triangles, it tastes great! I've been thinking about experimenting with coffee alternatives, since, as I mentioned in my previous update, that the beans are getting very expensive. I have an old vegetarian cookbook aboard that suggests making coffee from soybeans. When the weather is nicer, I will use the solar cooker and experiment! I will report on my findings!</p>

<p><b>QUOTES</b><q>I believe great art is like bypass surgery. It allows us to go around all of the psychological distancing mechanisms that turn people cold to the most vulnerable among us.</q><cite>Lin-Manuel Miranda</cite></p>

<![CDATA[<h2>2025-02-20 Beep-bapping</h2>

<p>On February 15th Devine & I celebrated our 9th year living aboard <a href="../site/pino.html">Pino</a>. Winters spent battling mold and condensation isn't always easy, but it is a minor inconvenience that does little to diminish my love of living aboard a sailboat.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I have begun sharing pages of a new <a href="../site/hakum.html">Hakum</a> short comic entitled <a href="../site/sabotage_study.html">sabotage study</a>. I've been meaning to share updates to this project for some time, I had started those first 2 pages months ago, but as I am juggling ten thousand projects I've had to prioritize. I've released a new page for <a href="../site/rabbit_waves.html">rabbit waves</a> about the importance of packing an <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/emergency_bag.html" target="_blank">emergency bag</a>, and made little animations to populate the <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/site/morse_flags.html" target="_blank">Morse Code with Flags</a> page.<br>I also cleaned up an old drawing I had done of black-headed gulls on a log to use as a divider for my update page (visible above). Seabirds on a log beep-bapping is a source of joy for me.</p> 

<p><b>SEWING</b>. I made a pouch for our <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/02/15.html" target="_blank">angle grinder</a>, and its <a href="https://rabbits.srht.site/days/2025/02/10.html" target="_blank">accompanying dics</a> out of some Sunbrella offcuts.</p>

<p><b>HOW-TO</b>. After Devine & I worked on a <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca/media/zines/communication.png" target="_blank">zine</a> for Rabbit Waves, I drew a guide on <a href="../site/folding_zine.html">how to fold a zine</a>.</p>

<p><b>HEALTH</b>. I've long stuggled with being me. I have difficulty trusting people, and can't seem to be able to regulate my emotions. I've always assumed that I was just broken, irreparable. On an especially bad day, crushed by self-hatred, I was desperate to find news ways to cope. In my research, I read through Edward Bowlby's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory" target="_blank">Attachment Theory</a>. A lot of my issues seem to stem from having an <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/anxious-preoccupied-attachment.html" target="_blank">anxious preoccupied attachment style</a>, possibly due to the fact that one of my caregivers also suffered from this. I have an undeveloped sense of self. My self-esteem has always been dependent on the closeness and approval of others. Knowing why I feel the way that I do helps, I feel less broken, less alone. I will write a long post about it sometime, but it needs more thought...</p>

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. I watched an English-subbed version of Das Leben der Anderen, a German film about the invasive monitoring of residents prevalent in East Berlin by the Stasi(1984). In the film, a Stasi officer is made to monitor(via bugs in the walls) a couple, a playwright and an actress, not because they are suspected of any wrongdoings, but because the Minister of Culture is romantically interested in the actress. The Stasi officer sits at a desk with headphones on all day, transcribing every uttered word, every movement. I will not spoil it further, but I really enjoyed it. Apparently, the idea for the film came as director/writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck was listening to music and remembered Maxim Gorky's saying that Lenin's favorite piece of music was Beethoven's Appassionata. Here's an excerpt of a conversation Gorky had with Lenin:</p>

<q>And screwing up his eyes and chuckling, Lenin added without mirth: But I can't listen to music often, it affects my nerves, it makes me want to say sweet nothings and pat the heads of people who, living in a filthy hell, can create such beauty. But today we mustn't pat anyone on the head or we'll get our hand bitten off; we've got to hit them on the heads, hit them without mercy, though in the ideal we are against doing any violence to people. Hm-hm—it's a hellishly difficult office!</q>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I am reading Middlemarch by George Eliot, a book with many older English words that are unfamiliar to me, and that I have to look up mid-read(a friend lent a physical copy of the book). Although, after reading Sherlock Holmes, some words like "pew" are now known to me, even if I have no real use for them in conversation. It's a long book, but I am enjoying it so far, George Eliot has a wonderful writing style, very precise, witty, and humorous at times.</p>

<p><b>MUSIC</b>. I've long been a fan of TOMM¥ €A$H, and it's why I was excited to see that he was entering the 2025 Eurovision song contest for Estonia. His entry, <a href="https://youtu.be/o6aJJ6Q5zhg?si=zPl5EoBFdkgbB3M3" target="_blank">Expresso Macchiato</a>, is very fun and catchy, moreso because it is laced with criticism of consumerism and globalism. It is his most family-friendly song ever, in that there are zero mentions of sex or weed. I especially love that the video was inspired by an 1982 <a href="https://youtu.be/sUd4L1oSXoE?si=lrBR1Mt0S-A8pRGO" target="_blank">video</a> of Andy Warhol eating a Burger King Whopper burger(filmed as part of Jorgen Leth's art film 66 Scenes from America, 1981) for four minutes and 20 seconds.<br><i>"As an immigrant, Warhol admired the idea that in America the same food and drinks are consumed by people regardless of their status – the president drinks the same Coke as him. The clash of cultures deeply influenced the subject matter of his art. A burger might as well appear as a tribute to the idea of American life."</i><br>Listening to this song, I am reminded that with the rising price of coffee, that I ought to enjoy it while I can still afford it. I buy 2.2 kg bags of whole beans at a local store, and I've had to pay 10$ more than last year. It is crazy to think that something as ubiquitous as coffee will eventually be a luxury.</p>

  <title>Goblins</title>

<![CDATA[<h2>2025-02-02 Goblins</h2>

<p>>It was a busy, cold month. I am doing my best to not read headlines, because the 24-hour news cycle only serves to overwhelm, and to distract. When things go to shit, art is and will always be a worthwhile refuge.</p>

<p><b>ARTICLES</b>. I wrote a post detailing on why I stopped drinking alcohol: <a href="../site/no_alcohol.html">no alcohol</a>.</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I participated in Goblin Week and drew lots and lots of {goblins}! My focus this month has also been into making a 1-bit version of <a href="../site/oquonie.html">Oquonie</a> for Playdate, I revisited all of the assets for the project. This version of Oquonie was shipped with the soundtrack from the original iOS game! This month I also designed some very cute two-headed beasts, which I've affectionately nicknamed Tchouni and Bombafu, for <a href="../site/tote.html">Tote</a>.</p> 

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. My sister encouraged me to watch Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, and it did not disappoint. It has pretty shit ratings online, but I thought it was a super fun, and surprisingly addictive, movie. What is more interesting is that it was written by Will Ferrel and Harper Steele, long-time friends. Both recently starred in a documentary called Will & Harper, which follows the same two aforementionned people on a road trip across the United States, a trip that Harper had done many times in the past, but now it would be her first time doing it as a woman(having recently transitioned). It was a heart-wrenching, but important movie to watch.</p>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I started reading <i>How do You Live</i> by Genzaburo Yoshino. It was a book I had tried reading aloud to Devine a few months back, but I had trouble getting into it because we found that the writing(Bruno Navasky's translation) was not especially good. I picked it up again the other day with the goal of finishing it to try and understand why it was so important to Hayao Miyazaki(the book was the inspiration for his latest film The Boy and the Heron). A young Japanese boy named Copper(Koperu) learns, through his family and friends, about social inequality, the value of hard work, and on how everything and everyone is inextricably linked, etc. How Do You Live invites the reader to be curious, and kind. I do like how the author uses storytelling to impart values, but it has the same issues as Sophie's World, in that I wish that these lessons were better integrated so as to not feel overly preachy.</p>

<p><b>QUOTES</b><q>Plato imagined a class of rulers in his ideal Republic who would not own property at all. He proposed that no system of government could be just if the leaders were primarily concerned with their own personal wealth and the future wealth of their children. How can any leader successfully work for the health and prosperity of their society if they are simultaneously trying to preserve or grow the contents of their own purse? Property, by its unequal distribution in society, made people selfish. Plato believed that this selfishness weakened the state. He believed that petty concerns over the acquisition of material things distracted the mind from the pursuit of justice.</q><cite>From Everyday Utopia by Kristen R. Ghodsee</cite></p>

  <title>Stormy seas</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>This past month has been very stormy, and when I say this I mean that the recent weather in the Salish Sea has been a bit crazy of late(lots of 40-60 kt wind days), but also that I am witnessing a real life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy" target="_blank">Idiocracy</a> in the making. It's not all bad though, it was a very productive month!</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I illustrated some <a href="../media/content/stream/salmonlice2_1200.jpg">Atlantic Salmon and a Sea Louse</a> for a presentation at <a href="https://masts.ac.uk/annual-science-meeting/" target="_blank">MASTS's</a> Annual Science Meeting about the effects of salmon farms on the wider ecosystem. The drawings will also appear in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05502" target="_blank">accompanying paper</a>! It is my first time contributing to a scientific paper, and that's pretty neat (I was even assigned an Erdős number).<br><a href="https://100r.co/site/rabbit_waves.html" target="_blank">Rabbit Waves</a> was announced officially! I've since released two more pages, one about Morse Code and another on using flags to signal Morse Code. The project was well received, I got a lot of good comments. Devine & I put a lot of care into making the website accessible to people with screen readers (thank you Rembrand for your helpful feedback on this).</p> 

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. This month I've been reading yet another Arthur Conan Doyle book aloud to Devine, The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. As always, it is a very entertaining read. I enjoy that perpetrators are not always prosecuted, sometimes people commit crimes out of desperation, or are victims of an unfortunate series of events, Holmes, despite collaborating with officials, is a very fair man(a rare quality).</p>

<p><b>TRICKS</b>. I use YouTube often but I despise the interface, but I found a solution! I installed <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/untrap-for-youtube/" target="_blank">Untrap</a>, a Firefox add-on. I turned off suggested videos, shorts, likes, comments, and tons of others buttons and distraction-ware on mine. My homepage is now just a blank page with a search bar — total bliss!<br>I stitched a pair of <a href="../site/sewing.html">arm warmers</a> for myself and for Devine to keep our hands warm. I used to wear arm warmers all the time as a teen, but never thought of making my own until now.</p>

<p><b>MENTAL HEALTH</b>. I added a page on my site called <a href="../site/happynothappy.html">Happynothappy</a>, which is just a very simple way to track how I feel from day to day. It would be more beneficial to track reasons as to why I feel a certain way on certain days, but for now I just want to keep it simple, otherwise I run the risk of abandoning the whole endeavour. <a href="https://nchrs.xyz/" target="_blank">Rostiger</a> made their own <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~rostiger/happyNotHappy" target="_blank">version</a> of my very basic tracker, which is a thousand times superior to mine, hehe!</p>

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. I saw the Rocky Horror Picture Show for the first time ever at the Vic Theater on October 27th. Of course, having never seen the film, most of the memes were lost on me, but thankfully I had read about what to expect so it was not too shocking to receive pieces of cooked toast and rice on my head. Tim Curry is absolutely brilliant in this role! He has such an amazing command of his expressions, it is evident that he has a background in theater. Luckily, I can watch the film again and again on my own because it is available for download on <a href="https://archive.org/details/rockyhorrorpictureshow">archive.org</a>.<br>I also watched 2 french comedies I hadn't previously seen: 3 Hommes et Un Couffin by Coline Serreau(same person who directed the amazing La Belle Verte), and Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis by Dany Boon. The storylines of both films were predictable, but still very enjoyable(more so than their English counterparts).</p>

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION</b> Trans people in the US are not likely to get support now that the orange man is back in power, and it is likely that some of the rhetoric will spill over our side of the border. There are many organizations that exist to improve queer, trans, and Two-Spirit lives in Canada. You can find organizations in your area using the <a href="https://egale.ca/rainbow-action-hub/#tab-local" target="_blank">Rainbow Action Hub</a> on Egale's website. I've recently donated a binder to <a href="https://qmunity.ca/about/" target="_blank">Qmunity</a> in Vancouver.<br>If you recall, I recently shared Given and C.C.'s gofundme page, their funding target was reached and the campaign has ended, but they still need help.

  <title>Shades of Bacchus!</title>

<![CDATA[
<p>Hello all! In the 1934 film It's A Gift, a brat drops grapes on a man's face, after which he shouts "Shades of Bacchus!" Bacchus is the god of wine in Roman mythology. Dev & I heard this said in the 4th season of What we Do in the Shadows, said by the energy vampire Colin Robinson in a moment that doesn't involve wine or grapes, merely to express surprise, but we loved this saying so much that we have since adopted it. And now, your life too has been enriched by having learned that this expression exists.<br>Now on to the updates of the month!</p>

<p><b>WEBSITE NEWS</b>. This website now has a <b>light mode</b>! I should have implemented this ages ago, all of my other websites have a light/dark mode, but now it's done! If your browser preferences are set for light mode, you'll see it. The default is still the dark mode, because it's what my eyes prefer.<br>In other website-related news, I wrote a post called <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/keeping_teeth_healthy.html" target="_blank">keeping teeth healthy</a>. I was hesitant to share it publicly because I was embarrassed to admit of being bad at taking care of my teeth, but I got a lot of support from others who suffered the same problems. Body maintenance is difficult, I ought not to be embarrassed about it, I will likely continue to learn how to do things better till I die.</p>

<p><b>SAILING</b>. Pino is back on the Victoria docks. I was looking forward to it this year, I was glad to have access to water on tap again. In the summer, water in the Salish Sea is a rare commodity, we have to use it like the precious resource that it is. This translates to not doing laundry, and by not taking quality showers aboard for 5 months. The water in our tanks is for drinking, and for cleaning dishes only(when water is especially low, I usually use a pressure sprayer and do the dishes in the cockpit). After a summer of hard sailing, Pino is a damn mess. I've already cleaned the gunk out of the quarter berth and galley, but each space needs a good exorcism.<br>Being back near a city also means that Dev & I can <a href="https://100r.co/site/store.html#stickers" target="_blank">ship stickers</a> again! I've put items in my <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/store.html" target="_blank">store</a> back online(still selling some mushroom drawings). Devine found a spirograph set for 5$ at a thrift store, we now make intricate patterns on all of the letters that we ship!</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stream/2024_spiro.jpg"/>

<p><b>ART</b>. I bought myself a set of coloring pencils! I got them specifically for the <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca" target="_blank">Rabbit Waves</a> project, for illustrations that need a touch of color. I am creating content for it almost everyday! The project is not released yet, but it'll be out before the end of the month.<br>The bird in the drawing below is a long-billed murrelet, a bird that hangs around the east coast of Russia and Northern Japan. I have never seen this particular type of murrelet, but I have seen Kittlitz's murrelets while sailing in Southeast Alaska. They are such beautiful, tiny birds! They are like small compact auks, measuring about 25 cm (9.8 in). Yes, rabbit waves will have rabbits, but also plenty of seabirds.</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.camedia/content/stream/2024_ics.jpg"/>

<p><b>FONT</b>. I fixed a few issues with the font for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/hakum.html" target="_blank">Hakum</a>. Had bad kerning between n & l (the word only comes up a <b>lot</b>). I also moved the apostrophe, hyphen, and the plus sign higher. The font is still not 100% perfect, I fix it when I find the time. I'd also really like to add glyphs for french(é è ê) at some point. See <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/making_a_font.html" target="_blank">Making a Font</a>. I didn't have time to work on Hakum at all this month, I am sad about this, but I'm prioritizing rabbit waves at the moment.</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/stream/2024_font.jpg"/>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. I finished reading Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary. I did not expect to like this book so much, the Martian was ok, but this book isn't only about solving problems in a hostile environment(space), it's also about camaraderie. It is difficult to explain why I loved the book without spoiling it, but I will say that the main character's encounter with Rocky really makes this book shine.</p>

<p><b>MOVIES</b>. I learned that Boots Riley, the director/screenwriter of Sorry to Bother You, a film that I loved, had also recently directed the series <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_a_Virgo" target="_blank">I'm a Virgo</a>. I finally got around to watching it, and holy crap...it is very, very good! The characters were well-crafted, the world was fun and created with purpose(to talk about corporatocracy, oppression and exploitation). Then there's Parking Tickets, a fictional animated TV show within the I’m a Virgo universe. Parking Tickets is dark, it grips you and doesn't let go. I enjoyed reading about the show within a show in this <a href="https://www.awn.com/animationworld/mystery-meat-media-unpacks-im-virgo-animation-and-meta-understanding-audiences" target="_blank">article</a>.<br>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRkph6XdzYc" target="_blank">Yintah</a>, a CBC documentary following indigenous land defenders in a decade-long fight to keep fossil fuel companies from building pipelines on their traditional lands. Watching this I was completely disgusted at the hypocrisy and barrage of lies coming out of the mouths of Canadian Government officials, pipeline workers and the police/RCMP. Their eyes are set on resource extraction and nothing will keep them from achieving their goals, Indigenous people know that better than anyone.<br>Reconciliation is a word that is thrown around to appease voters, it's an illusion, behind the curtain the Canadian Government is still using century-old tactics to remove Indigenous people from their lands.</p>
<p><i>"I want to buy your horse," an American settler says to an indigenous man. "No, I want to keep my horse," the indigenous man says. Dissatisfied with this response, hellbent on getting the man's horse, the settler goes to another indigenous man, "I want to buy <b>that</b> horse," he says, asking permission from someone who doesn't have the authority to give that horse away.</i></p>
<p>This short skit illustrates well how land was seized in the past, and what is still done today when governments want something from Indigenous people. A few weeks ago, I finished reading I Will Fight No More Forever by Merrill D. Beal, documenting how the American settlers displaced the Nez Perces from their lands. Back in 1877, Chief Joseph too was suffering the lies of government officials: "It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken promises." Good words do not last long unless they amount to something.</p>

<p><b>QUOTES</b><q>I have carried a heavy load on my back ever since I was a boy. I learned then that we were but few while the white men were many, and that we could not hold our own with them. We were like deer. They were like grizzly bears. We had a small country. Their country was large. We were contented to let things remain as the Great Spirit Chief made them. They were not; and would change the mountains and rivers if they did not suit them.</q><cite>A quote by Chief Joseph</cite></p>

<p><b>MUSIC</b>. I am head over heels for the techno mix <a href="https://on.soundcloud.com/RsqQqZcBy12favzw5" target="_blank">BEHEĀDER - LA FORZA</a>. I have a strange relationship with music, songs affect me deeply, beautiful voices and arrangements have the power to bring me to tears. Devine sent me an article called <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/11/6/884/2223400?login=false" target="_blank">Brain connectivity reflects human aesthetic responses to music</a>, which sets out to explain how certain individuals have strong emotional reactions to music.</p>

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION</b>. Given and C.C., two bright stars are struggling to stay afloat. Circumstances have compelled them to live nomadically. They lack a legal residence anywhere and have neither pensions nor access to banking, social support or medical services. They make due with meagre finances and fend off the increasing pressures of age (C.C. turns 70 this year) and chronic illness. I have donated to their cause many times, but support from many more people would help them ensure that they can continue to get prescription medicines, medical care, as well as the basic requirements of keeping an old boat — their home — afloat for a longer chunk of time, which in turn will help alleviate some stress. <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/a-voyage-in-search-of-home" target="_blank">Give what you can</a>.</p>

<p>I'm going to try something new this month, a long-form, highly detailed journal, which chronicles the projects I've done, but also things I am interested in, what I've read, etc. I share a lot of this stuff on Mastodon, but it's a shame that it isn't also present on my website. These thoughts will now live here too. Here we go!</p>

<p><b>SAILING</b>. Where's Pino now? We are anchored on Galiano Island, comfortably nested in the Gulf Islands of British Columbia. We spent time in Melanie Cove earlier this month too. We wanted a taste of summer weather, we got it. Some days were very warm, too warm to hike. Pino will be returning to the Victoria docks in the fall, I look forward to it. I really miss using our sewing machine, I have many projects in mind!</p>

<p>I started to transcribe the entries of the Victoria to Sitka logbook digitally, I've already published <a href="https://100r.co/site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html" target="_blank">the first two weeks</a>. As promised, the log features many silly doodles. Silly doodles are my lifeblood. People who have already read through the log told me how much they liked the black-headed gull syndicate, I am glad of it, it was a recurring joke on that trip. Gulls on logs were a common, and welcome sight. I have many more weeks to transcribe, it will take a long while to go through it all!</p>

<p><b>ART</b>. I've been doodling one of my older ocs Shane "Shock" Evans a lot. I used Shane when roleplaying with a friend in the pokemon universe. I'd love to "recycle" this character into another story, albeit with some improvements, because his current personality requires some considerable finessing. I tend to become very attached to my characters. I always end up reusing them in other projects, although sometimes they're so different that it is impossible to know who they stemmed from. Lupen, from my story <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/wiktopher.html" target="_blank"</a>Wiktopher</a>, actually shares Shane's haircut (although Shane wore it first), but they're nothing alike.</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/oc_shock_together.jpg"/>

<p><b>BOOKS</b>. Earlier this month, I finished reading Arthur Conan Doyle's <b>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</b>. I really enjoyed it, while being familiar with the character — I think most of the English speaking world is — it was my first time reading any of his stories. I love Watson’s constant amazement of Holmes’s observation and deducting skills. “My dear Holmes!” He’d often say, awestruck, after hearing Holmes detail the life a client he’d just met with great accuracy. I recommend it, although the fact that he casually takes cocaine was a bit jarring. Taking cocaine was a "hip" thing to do in 19th century England, but mostly because it wasn't well understood. When the dangers of cocaine became known, Arthur C. D. adapted the story, with Watson helping to wean Holmes off the drug. I love that he didn't double down on his character's use of the drug. The author used words that were at times surprising, like saying "he ejaculated" after a character speaks in a sudden manner. The definition of the word when used with speech reads like this: <i>"To throw out, as an exclamation; to utter by a brief and sudden impulse; as, to ejaculate a prayer."</i> Using it to illustrate something said swifty and suddenly is brilliant, I love the image that it summons in my mind(not the one you're thinking of, you silly rabbit). Unfortunately, its use for anything other than "ejecting semen" will forever be strange in modern times.</p>

<p>I am still reading through Don Norman's book <b>The Design of Everyday Things</b>. I've become more observant, and critical, of the objects around me. It is a wonder that so many terrible products end up in people's hands. I learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Toyota_Way" target="_blank">The Toyota Way</a>, which is a set of principles that focuses on reducing waste, increasing productivity, and maintaining a high-quality standard, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muda_(Japanese_term)" target="_blank">Muda (無駄)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomation" target="_blank">jidoka (自働化)</a>. I created a page on my website named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/good_enough_arithmetic.html">good enough arithmetics</a>, coined by Don, to remind myself that precision isn't always necessary. When I shared my notes on Mastodon, someone linked an amazing <a href="https://seweverythingblog.com/2020/05/12/the-hand-as-measuring-device/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on how to use your hand as a measuring device to take approximate measurements. I LOVE that idea! I included some fun ASCII art in the documentation to break the monotony. Drawing hands in ASCII was not easy, but it was fun to try! The book is dry at times, but the lessons are invaluable.</p>

<p>As a last mention of books, I will say that I've been reading Andy Weir's Project Hail Mary aloud to Devine every night. The casual format makes it difficult to stop, we are enjoying it so far, although Ryland Grace, the main character, sounds and behaves exactly like the star of Weir's other book Mark Watney (The Martian). I suspect that he injects a lot of himself into his characters.</p>

<p><b>RABBITS</b>. I've got rabbits on the brain. Last August we went walking on a trail on Cortes Island with our friends Rik & Kay, they sent me photos from that walk, which of course, ended up becoming part of the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/wunderland_rabbits.html">wunderland rabbits</a> project. I am especially pleased with this one. Rabbits in the ferns!</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/wunderland_14_full.jpg"/>

<p> What I am most happy about is that I found another way to do the dithering. I used to have a local copy of <a href="https://ditherit.com/" target="_blank">Dither-it</a>, and used the Atskinson algorithm to get the look I wanted, but when I switched from <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/vincent.html">Vincent</a> to <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/obi.html">Obi</a> I forgot to clone the repository, when I was working on this picture I didn't have good enough cell coverage to download it. I ended up toying with Krita, and found an option under Filter>Artistic named Index Colors, which does EXACTLY what I want! I can change the colors under Ramps, and the results are just as good as those produced when using Dither-it. Of course, Dither-it is a really neat tool and I will continue to recommend it, but it is neat that Krita can produce similar results(I haven't found an equivalent in Gimp).</p>

<p>Also, maybe it is a bit too early to announce it, but in rabbit-related news I registered a new domain named <a href="https://rabbitwaves.ca" target="_blank">RabbitWaves</a> for a very special project. The site doesn't have much on it yet, it will soon!</p>

<img src="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/rabbitwaves_01.jpg"/>

<p><b>MUSIC</b>. <a href="https://voidxwitch.com/" target="_blank">Voidxwitch</a> released their new single <a href="https://voidxwitch.bandcamp.com/track/beast-of-the-black-hill" target="_blank">The Beast of the Black Hill</a> and it is excellent! This song is dominating my life, I cannot persuade it to leave my head. Give it a listen!<br>Falling in Reverse's <a href="https://youtu.be/hX0lhueeib8?si=L2BP-4y3h6bKOClE" target="_blank">Prequel</a> is also highly addictive. As on the commenters on YouTube so rightly said, "Falling In Reverse is no longer a band, they are an experience."</p>

<p><b>TRICKS N THINGS</b>. I learned that it was possible to use <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/spellbook.html#terminal_calculator">the terminal as a calculator</a> this month. I really wish I had learned this before! I am constantly doing conversions, being able to do it via the command line simplifies thing! Of course, one cannot just type equations in the terminal, it is necessary to summon <b>bc</b> first. BC was already installed on Manjaro, handy!</p>

<p><b>CALL TO ACTION</b>. As you may have heard, Paul Watson, the founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, was arrested by Danish police. <i>"Danish authorities claim that the arrest was made due to an international arrest warrant issued by Japan, related to his anti-whaling campaigns in the Antarctic more than a decade ago. Paul faces the possibility of extradition to Japan, where he could spend the rest of his life in prison."</i> Protection nature ought not to be a crime. If you can spare some time, <a href="https://www.paulwatsonfoundation.org/freepaulwatson/" target="_blank">sign this petition</a>.</p>

<p>Also, if you can, buy prints/or commmission a human artist that you like. With the use of AI becoming ubiquitous, they need your support right now, more than ever.</p>

<p>Pino and crew arrived back in familiar waters on August 11th, a bit earlier than we had planned, but after many grey months, we were both looking forward to experiencing some form of summer-like weather. We anchored in Von Donop inlet on Cortes Island, a good place to chill out and to get things done.</p>

<p>My mind has been occupied with weather and currents of late, now that we are still, I have room in my head to tackle some difficult problems.</p>

<p>I finished a new comic sequence for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html" target="_blank">Hakum</a> named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/smile.html" target="_blank">Smile</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p>A month of upwind sailing, fog, and motoring painfully slowly over still waters, the way back south through northern Canada has not been easy. We had to do short hops between anchorages, and often had to stay for 2-3 days at each stop to wait for favorable weather to keep going. {Obi} has not seen much use, grey days, lack of solar power, make working on the computer difficult, so I've been drawing, mostly, and writing in my logbook.</p>

<p>I drew the cast of {Hakum}, when they're a bit <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_gang_1990.jpg" target="_blank">younger</a>, and then <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_gang_2000.jpg" target="_blank">older with some new members</a>. I also completed a very short vignette comic named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_shoes.jpg" target="_blank">Shoes</a>, Dae spends all his time in the forest, never wears shoes, and never rode a bike before.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Devine & I have resumed work on {Markl}. We hope to publish it on the Playdate along with {Oquonie}. The Playdate has been a good source of entertainment for me while at anchor, I especially enjoyed the game Saturday Edition by Chris Makris.</p>

<![CDATA[<p>Pino and crew have sailed back to Canada 2 days ago, landing back in Prince Rupert. We'll slowly make our way back south now.</p>

<p>We've traveled many miles, we completed a loop through Southeast Alaska, passing close to the mainland through Wrangell, Petersburg, and then through Frederick Sound to Sitka, then down down down on the outside waters of Baranof and Dall Island, through Dixon Entrance and into port at Prince Rupert. Sailing in outer waters was lovely, especially on the first day, the sea was smooth, as was the wind, I saw a ton of wildlife. I saw black-footed albatrosses, the last time I saw them was on our Japan to Canada sail in 2020, they are large brown birds with dramatic markings around their eyes, locking their expression into one of constant mourning. As Pino sailed by the Hazy Islands, I saw my first puffin! The Hazy Islands are far offshore, away from traffic and human encroachment, boats can't land there, neither can planes, it's a perfect place for birds, they have a world of their own out there.</p>

<p>The second offshore leg was not as lovely, with big waves at our stern, strong winds, too. "Don't take me again," I said to the sea, "please don't." I kept one hand on the tiller, the other gripped the frame of our roll cage, ready in case the waves decided to misbehave. Further into Dixon Entrance the waves diminished along with any threat of being taken, I was relieved.</p>

<p>I write in my logbook everyday, I don't have creative energy for anything else right now. I draw once in a while, not as often as I'd like. Hopefully, once we get nearer to Vancouver Island, we can find a place to stay put for a few weeks. Yes, weeks, a place with good hiking nearby, a quiet place for deep thinking.</p>

<p>This trip has challenged my strength. I am a human windlass, a haphazard diesel engine mechanic, a nervous wreck at times... but like our strong little ship I too can weather storms.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>Just a short update to say that Devine & I have been sailing since May 1st, leaving from Victoria, B.C. We arrived in Ketchikan, Southeast Alaska(US) on June 2nd. We spent all of May moving, taking every weather window we could to make as much progress north as possible. It is tiring, but now that we've arrived a bit higher north we can it a bit slower.</p>

<p>May and June are good months to spend in SE Alaska. It's been very rainy and windy since we've arrived, I'm not sure what nice looks like in these parts... I look forward to it, though. We find cell reception here and there, permitting for updates like this. We'll explore the area, and start making our way back down late July.</p>

<p>I won't be updating this site much in the meantime, maybe just small improvements or notes here and there. Like today, as we are waiting for bad weather to pass in Ketchikan, I worked on the {finic} language. I've got plans for another {Wiktopher} book, so I'm just jotting down ideas. Because I am away, my store is closed, I will put the {Vancouver Island Mushrooms} series back for sale when I return in October. See you then!</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I finished the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a> sequence <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/kaizah.html">Kaizah</a>. I'm pleased with the result! I also went over a lot of the comics in the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum_archive.html">Hakum Archive</a>, as I've said before they are no longer canon, but I did update some of the text anyway to bring them more in line. The handwritten text wasn't easy to read, so I updated all of them with the font I made(see <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/making_a_font.html">Making a font</a>). I also published an older short sequence I had finished named <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/aftermath.html">Aftermath</a> that follows <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/night_terror.html">Night Terror</a>, a short comic to show that Dae and Seir have a really difficult relationship.</p>

<p>I released a new <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/wunderland_13_full.jpg">Wunderland Rabbits</a> image. Spring is here on the West Coast of Canada, camas plants are in full bloom. We are getting ready to depart for northern waters, filling the boat with food, gathering e-books, etc.</p>

<p>Because I am learning <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/modern_standard_arabic.html">Modern Standard Arabic</a> on the side, I've started keeping notes! I will append to this page as I go.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>My website now has a splash page! Hovering the cursor over characters reveals little speech bubbles, it's possible to click on those and it'll take you somewhere on this site. If ever clicking/hovering on the image doesn't occur to people, I also added a re-direct that kicks in after 10 seconds.</p>

<p>I am still working on the new comic sequence for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a>. Unlike previous releases, where I would publish pages as I finished them, I will publish them all at once. Here is a <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/hakum_preview_240404.jpg" target="_blank">sneak peek</a>.</p>

<p>A few months ago I bought some mochigome(sticky Japanese rice) with the goal of learning how to make mochi. It took me a long time to try because I wasn't sure it was possible to do by hand on the boat. Most tutorials require the use of powered appliances. I've seen Japanese do it by hand by rapidly beating the dough with a mallet, I knew I couldn't do exactly that, but I had a pestle. I cooked the rice, transferred the rice to a bowl, crushed the rice with a potato masher, then went to work beating the dough using my pestle. It's hard work, it took me around 15 minutes of constant beating to get it to a sticky, cohesive mass. Then, I used plenty of cornstarch to separate the dough into 10 balls. Devine & I later cooked the balls with roasted sesame oil in a pan. The result was rice cakes that were crunchy on the outside, and soft and sticky on the inside. We'll make mochi again for sure, maybe next time we'll try to stuff the sticky dough with sweet red beans(anko). See <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/galley_experiment_mochi.jpg" target="_blank">the result</a>.</p>

<p>I made another small <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/rope_mats.html">rope mat</a> for <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/pino.html">Pino</a> earlier this month. The <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/ropemats_blackrug.jpg">little black mat</a> was even featured in the latest hundred rabbits <a href="https://100r.co/media/content/videos/march_2024.jpg" target="_blank">newsletter</a>(without the flemish coil). If you're wondering what Little Ninj is doing in the image, he is trying to flatten the mat. When a new mat is finished it won't be comfortable to step on because the ropes are still round, but if the mat is set on the floor, time and the passing of feet will flatten it out. Stamping on a mat repeatedly is a quick way to flatten it, it's also possible to use a rubber mallet. Generally, we tolerate the initial discomfort and wait for the material to settle on its own.</p>

<p>In the interest of conserving useful articles about boating/sailing, I mirrored two articles on my website: <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/defensive_boating.html" target="_blank">defensive boating</a> and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/gunwale_and_hull_cushioning.html" target="_blank">gunwale and hull cushioning</a>.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>I added instructions on how to make small <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/rope_mats.html">rope mats</a>, the images are at the end of the post. I also shared instructions on how to make <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/a_good_friction_hitch.html">a good friction hitch</a>. Yep, I've been getting back into knotting lately! I documented some of the <a href="https://100r.co/site/knots.html" target="_blank">knots</a> that Dev & I use the most aboard <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/pino.html">Pino</a> on the 100r website.</p>

<p>I improved the look of the <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a> page, adding small graphics and trying to space out the content better to make it more pleasant to read (I have a tendency to pack a lot of text in a single page *sweats*). I started a new comic sequence but progress is slow because Dev & I are preparing for a big sailing trip this summer. We hope to make it to Northern B.C., near the Alaskan border. I spend my days studying guide books and charts, trying to understand how the wind and current behaves. This coast is not easy to sail, but we want to get better acquainted with it, even if it means getting uncomfortable for a short while.</p>]]>

<![CDATA[<p>February 14th marks my 8th year living aboard <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site//pino.html>Pino</a>! The boat is doing well, although Dev & I both suffered a cold these past few days. We are two disgusting snot fountains.</p>

<p>Because it is becoming harder and harder to find good information on the internet by way of search engines, I overhauled my list of <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/bookmarks">bookmarks</a>, documenting my favorite websites and resources to try and combat AI garbage generators and websites that spin content. Building lists of trusted links written by experienced and well-meaning humans, and hosting them on your website, is a good way to create a network of trust.</p>

<p>I completed <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/ruler_of_the_taiga.html">Ruler of the Taiga</a>. It is annoying how even if I just completed <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/night_terror.html">Night Terror</a>, I already dislike a lot of the art. My hand and my eye keeps improving, it's a good thing but it makes it difficult to appreciate work now that I was proud of at the time of completion. The spell wears off so quickly. I am glad I am improving, but I hate being this inconsistent. I've always assumed that once I learned to draw that I could only get better at it, that regressing was not possible, but if there are too many long lulls between drawing sessions(months, years...) I realized that it is possible to lose it. The skill isn't lost entirely, but the work can appear stiff. Drawing will always make me happy, but I hope that my work eventually stabilizes. Note that this 'regression' is only true when drawing characters with realistic proportions (projects like <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/hakum.html">Hakum</a>, and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/circa.html">Circa</a>), errors are more apparent in designs like this than with a project with a cartoon style like <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/mindbird.html">mindbird</a>.</p>

<p>I did a few <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/sprite.html">sprite</a> commissions, see <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/sprite/sprite_43_full.jpg">Alex P.</a>, <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/sprite/sprite_44_full.jpg">Benji and family(1)</a>, and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/sprite/sprite_45_full.jpg">Benji(2)</a>.</p>

<p>I made some modifications to <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/rope_mats.html">rope mats</a>, so that intructions are clearer. I made a tiny mat out of red paracord for a friend this month for v-day, I missed making mats, I plan to make more this month.</p>]]>

<p>Wahoo! <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/night_terror.html">Night Terror</a> is finished! Currently sketching a new sequence which I look forward to sharing :>!</p>

<p>I did a few <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/sprite.html'>sprite</a> commissions this month, see <a href="https://kokorobot.ca//media/content/project/sprite/sprite_42_full.jpg">Alex</a>, <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/media/content/project/sprite/sprite_41_full.jpg">Squid</a>, and <a href="https://kokorobot.ca/site/media/content/project/sprite/sprite_40_full.jpg">Sofia</a>.</p>

<p>I added a bunch of new(old) production art to <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/uno.html'>uno</a> and <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/wiktopher.html'>wiktopher</a>. I'm trying to gather all of my art on this website, even the really old stuff (see <a href='https://kokorobot.ca/site/old_art.html'>old art</a>). I logged into DeviantArt the other day and saw how they had fully intergrated AI into their platform, which makes me so, so sad. As HelveticaBlanc said so well in a <a href="https://merveilles.town/@helveticablanc/111769636001496627" target="_blank">recent toot</a>(Mastodon): <i>"I don't wanna see AI in any form, even as a joke. It's a nightmare for labor and the environment, an insult to the spirit of art, and I'm fully on the side of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_(franchise)#The_Butlerian_Jihad" target="_blank">Butlerian Jihad</a>."</i> Yes, me too. AI art is hollow, it is a grotesque parody of what it is to be human.</p>

<p>I've had two accounts parked on DA for the longest time (@esserawks and @mintenko), I kept them for memory's sake, but after seeing what DA has become I've decided to deactivate them. All of my art lives on this page now.</p>]]>
